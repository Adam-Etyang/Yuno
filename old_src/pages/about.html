          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Born from the frustration of endless email chains, double bookings, and missed opportunities, 
            <span class="highlight">Yuno</span> emerged as a solution to the chaos that often defines campus resource management.
          </p>
          <p>
            We witnessed students struggling to reserve auditoriums for their presentations, faculty dealing with 
            scheduling conflicts, and administrators drowning in paperwork. There had to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team of passionate developers, designers, and campus life enthusiasts came together with one mission: 
            to create a platform that would <span class="highlight">streamline, simplify, and enhance</span> the entire campus booking experience.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="story-text">
          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>
            We envision a world where every campus operates like a well-orchestrated symphony, where resources are 
            utilized efficiently, and where students and faculty can focus on what truly matters ‚Äì 
            <span class="highlight">learning, growing, and creating</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yuno isn't just a booking platform; it's a catalyst for better campus experiences. We're building 
            technology that connects people, optimizes spaces, and creates opportunities for meaningful interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            From small study group reservations to large-scale conferences, we believe every event deserves 
            the perfect space and seamless planning experience.
